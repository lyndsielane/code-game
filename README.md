## Lyndsie's Code Game

Upon loading, the user is presented with simple instructions for the game and a start button. There is a link to the highscores in the top left corner if a user would like to view them before playing.
When the start button is pushed, the game cycles through 5 multiple choice coding questions. The answer choices change opaqueness upon hover. Any wrong choices deduct 12 seconds from the 60 total seconds given for game play. A response appears under the answer choices advising the user if their selection was correct or wrong. If the user doesn't complete all questions before time runs out, the game automatically ends. 
The score is based on the amount of time remaining upon game completion. Once the game is complete, the user is given their final score and asked to enter their initials. The initials and score are saved in local storage. 
Once the user submits their initials, a high score chart shows displaying the score just received and any previous scores (up to 10) saved in their local storage. The high score chare is sorted to show the top scores in descending order. A score will not save if the user hits submit without entering their initials. The highscores table also presents a play again button should the user wish to try again.
